Rock climbing social app!

Mobile app. when you open it, you have to log in/ make an account

When making an account, you need all of this:

email, name, age, location, years climbing, picture, description of how much gear they have 
(ropes, harnesses, shoes, atc devices, quickdraws, any trad gear)

users should be able to post on a calendar thing where/when they want to go, and see others posts on the calendar. 
For the calendar, there should be options to see only your calendar,you and your friends, maybe people in your area, and everyones calendar, 

One tab for messages, one tab for the calendar, one tab that is a public board separated by climbing spots, another tab for showing climbers near you.
. This board will let people post more 
informative content about how the climbing was, if they noticed anything important, yata yata. Maybe what kind of gear they needed, favorite climbs, etc.

If you see people in the discover tab or on the calendar, you should be able to send them friend requests. If they accept, then you both become
friends.
